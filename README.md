# Tilmeld Client

Client for Tilmeld, a Nymph user and group management with access controls.

## Deprecation Notice

The PHP implementation of Nymph/Tilmeld has been deprecated. It will no longer have any new features added. Instead, a new version of Nymph running on Node.js, written entirely in TypeScript will replace the PHP implementation. You can find it over at the [Nymph.js repo](https://github.com/sciactive/nymphjs).

## Installation

### Automatic Setup

The fastest way to start building a Nymph app is with the [Nymph App Template](https://github.com/hperrin/nymph-template).

### Manual Installation

```sh
npm install --save tilmeld-client
```
